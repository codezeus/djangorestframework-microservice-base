# Djangorestframework Microservice Base

This is a base template for a Docker microservice using djangorestframework. It
includes a basic user model with authentication using JWT.

For a pre-built container, you can use:

```
docker run -d dansackett/djangorestframework-base:1.0
```

This is built as a starting point though for building a full REST API. You can
fork this repository and use it to hit the ground running.
